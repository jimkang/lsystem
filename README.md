lsystem
=======

A module that lets you create [L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), which will take rules, then use those rules to transform strings into other strings.

For Node v4.0.0. and the browser (via Browserify and Babelify). On Node, requires that you run it with the ` --harmony_destructuring` or `--es_staging` switch. (Dag! I know, right?)

Installation
------------

    npm install lsystem

Usage
-----

    var LSystem = require('lsystem');
    var lsys = LSystem({
      initialState: 'A',
      rules: {
        A: 'AB',
        B: 'A'
      }
    });

    for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
      console.log(lsys.advance());
    }

Output:

    AB
    ABA
    ABAAB
    ABAABABA
    ABAABABAABAAB

API
---

**LSystem**

Creates an L-system. Opts:

  **initialState**: A string containing the symbols in the initial state of the system.
  **rules**: A dictionary mapping symbols to a string of symbols that they should produce. e.g. `A: 'AB'` indicates that when the system advances, instances of the symbol 'A' should become 'AB' in the next iteration.

**advance**

Advances the system one iteration. Applies the rules to the current state and updates the state. Returns the state.

**getState**

Gets the current state of the L-system, which is a string. e.g. 'ABAABABA'.

**getIteration**

Get the current iteration number.

Tests
-----

Run tests with `make test`.
